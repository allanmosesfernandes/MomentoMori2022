                "quote": "The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to\nmyself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I\nactually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but\nwithin myself to the choices that are my own . . .",
                "text": "The single most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating between what we can change\nand what we can’t. What we have influence over and what we do not. A flight is delayed because of\nweather—no amount of yelling at an airline representative will end a storm. No amount of wishing will\nmake you taller or shorter or born in a different country. No matter how hard you try, you can’t make\nsomeone like you. And on top of that, time spent hurling yourself at these immovable objects is time not\nspent on the things we can change.\nThe recovery community practices something called the Serenity Prayer: “God, grant me the serenity\nto accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the\ndifference.” Addicts cannot change the abuse suffered in childhood. They cannot undo the choices they\nhave made or the hurt they have caused. But they can change the future—through the power they have in\nthe present moment. As Epictetus said, they can control the choices they make right now.\nThe same is true for us today. If we can focus on making clear what parts of our day are within our\ncontrol and what parts are not, we will not only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over other\npeople who fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable battle.",

Even harder is saying no to certain time-consuming emotions: anger, excitement, distraction, obsession, lust. None of these impulses feels like a big deal by itself, but run amok, they become a commitment like anything else. If you’re not careful, these are precisely the impositions that will overwhelm and consume your life. Do you ever wonder how you can get some of your time back, how you can feel less busy? Start by learning the power of “No!”—as in “No, thank you,” and “No, I’m not going to get caught up in that,” and “No, I just can’t right now.” It may hurt some feelings. It may turn people off. It may take some hard work.But the more you say no to the things that don’t matter, the more you can say yes to the things that do. This will let you live and enjoy your life—the life that you want.",

It’s an inspiring example for us to think about today if we get tired, frustrated, or have to deal\nwith some crisis. Here was a guy who had every reason to be angry and bitter, who could have abandoned\nhis principles and lived in luxury or ease, who could have put his responsibilities aside and focused on\nhis own health.\nBut he never did. His soul stayed strong even after his body became weak. He didn’t give up, right up\nto the second until his body finally did—when he died near Vienna in 180 AD.",

Marcus, thankfully, was not exposed to these extreme parts of our modern culture. But he knew plenty of distracting sinkholes too: gossip, the endless call of work, as well as fear, suspicion, lust. Every human being is pulled by these internal and external forces that are increasingly more powerful and harder to resist. Philosophy is simply asking us to pay careful attention and to strive to be more than a pawn. As Viktor Frankl puts it in The Will to Meaning, “Man is pushed by drives but pulled by values.” These values and inner awareness prevent us from being puppets.

That’s not to say we’re always going to be 100 percent\ncertain of everything, or that we even should be. Rather, it’s that we can rest assured we’re heading\ngenerally in the right direction—that we don’t need to constantly compare ourselves with other people or\nchange our mind every three seconds based on new information.\nInstead, tranquility and peace are found in identifying our path and in sticking to it: staying the course\n—making adjustments here and there, naturally—but ignoring the distracting sirens who beckon us to turn\ntoward the rocks",

Fronto, widely considered to be Rome’s best orator besides Cicero, was chosen by Marcus’s adopted father to teach Marcus to think and write and speak. More than just pretty phrases, they gave him—and now us—a powerful perspective on ordinary or seemingly unbeautiful events. It takes an artist’s eye to see that the end of life is not unlike a ripe fruit falling from its tree. It takes a poet to notice the way “baking bread splits in places and those cracks, while not intended in the baker’s art, catch our eye and serve to stir our appetite” and find a metaphor in them.

If you’re looking for a place to start\nyour own ritual, you could do worse than Marcus’s example and Epictetus’s checklist.\nEvery day, starting today, ask yourself these same tough questions. Let philosophy and hard work\nguide you to better answers, one morning at a time, over the course of a life.",

How can I\nimprove?\nAt the beginning or end of each day, the Stoic sits down with his journal and reviews: what he did,\nwhat he thought, what could be improved. It’s for this reason that Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations is a\nsomewhat inscrutable book—it was for personal clarity and not public benefit. Writing down Stoic\nexercises was and is also a form of practicing them, just as repeating a prayer or hymn might be.\nKeep your own journal, whether it’s saved on a computer or in a little notebook. Take time to\nconsciously recall the events of the previous day. Be unflinching in your assessments. Notice what\ncontributed to your happiness and what detracted from it.

Paul Johnson once joked that\nEdmund Wilson read books “as though the author was on trial for his life.” That’s how Marcus read\nEpictetus—and when the lessons passed muster, he absorbed them.

Are we doing things for the right\nreasons? Or do we act because we haven’t stopped to think? Or do we believe that we have to do\nsomething?\nFinally, there is our judgment. Our ability to see things clearly and properly comes when we use our\ngreat gift from nature: reason.\nThese are three distinct areas of training, but in practice they are inextricably intertwined. Our\njudgment affects what we desire, our desires affect how we act, just as our judgment determines how we\nact. But we can’t just expect this to happen.

Roosevelt gave that speech shortly after he left office, at the height of his\npopularity. In a few years, he would run against his former protégé in an attempt to retake the White\nHouse, losing badly and nearly assassinated in the process. He would also nearly die exploring a river in\nthe Amazon, kill thousands of animals in African safaris, and then beg Woodrow Wilson to allow him to\nenlist in World War I despite being 59 years old. He would do a lot of things that seem somewhat baffling\nin retrospect.\nTheodore Roosevelt was a truly great man. But he was also driven by a compulsion, a work and\nactivity addiction that was seemingly without end. Many of us share this affliction—being driven by\nsomething we can’t control. We’re afraid of being still, so we seek out strife and action as a distraction.\nWe choose to be at war—in some cases, literally—when peace is in fact the more honorable and fitting\nchoice.\nYes, the man in the arena is admirable. As is the soldier and the politician and the businesswoman and\nall the other occupations. But, and this is a big but, only if we’re in the arena for the right reasons",

Nero, the student whose excesses Seneca tried to curb, killed not only his\nown mother and wife but eventually turned on Seneca, his mentor, too.\nThe combination of power, fear, and mania can be deadly. The leader, convinced that he might be\nbetrayed, acts first and betrays others first. Afraid that he’s not well liked, he works so hard to get others\nto like him that it has the opposite effect. Convinced of mismanagement, he micromanages and becomes\nthe source of the mismanagement. And on and on—the things we fear or dread, we blindly inflict on\nourselves.\nThe next time you are afraid of some supposedly disastrous outcome, remember that if you don’t\ncontrol your impulses, if you lose your self-control, you may be the very source of the disaster you so\nfear.

So it’s not so clear that power always corrupts.

From what we can gather about the play, Bellerophon,\nthe hero, comes to doubt the existence of the gods. But in this line, he is saying: Why bother getting mad at\ncauses and forces far bigger than us? Why do we take these things personally? After all, external events\nare not sentient beings—they cannot respond to our shouts and cries—and neither can the mostly\nindifferent gods.\nThat’s what Marcus was reminding himself of here: circumstances are incapable of considering or\ncaring for your feelings, your anxiety, or your excitement. They don’t care about your reaction. They are\nnot people. So stop acting like getting worked up is having an impact on a given situation. Situations don’t\ncare at all.",

    "text": "Socrates, perhaps the wisest person to ever live, used to say that “nobody does wrong willingly.”\nMeaning that no one is wrong on purpose either. Nobody thinks they’re wrong, even when they are.\nThey think they’re right, they’re just mistaken. Otherwise, they wouldn’t think it anymore!\nCould it be that the slights you’ve experienced or the harm that others have done to you was not\ninflicted intentionally? What if they simply thought they were doing the right thing—for them, even for\nyou? It’s like the memorial for Confederate soldiers at Arlington (obviously a cause that was wrongly\nfought for by people doing wrong), which states, in part, that the Confederate soldiers served “in simple\nobedience to duty, as they understood it.” Again—they understood wrongly, but it was their genuine\nunderstanding, just as Lincoln was genuine when he ended his famous Cooper Union speech by saying,\n“Let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.”\nHow much more tolerant and understanding would you be today if you could see the actions of other\npeople as attempts to do the right thing? Whether you agree or not, how radically would this lens change\nyour perspective on otherwise offensive or belligerent actions?",

    "text": "Part of the reason we fight against the things that happen is that we’re so focused on our plan that we\nforget that there might be a bigger plan we don’t know about. Is it not the case that plenty of times\nsomething we thought was a disaster turned out to be, with the passage of time, a lucky break? We also\nforget that we’re not the only people who matter and that our loss might be someone else’s gain.\nThis sense of being wronged is a simple awareness problem. We need to remember that all things are\nguided by reason—but that it is a vast and universal reason that we cannot always see. That the surprise\nhurricane was the result of a butterfly flapping its wings a hemisphere away or that misfortune we have\nexperienced is simply the prelude to a pleasant and enviable future.",

    "text": "Self-deception, delusions of grandeur—these aren’t just annoying personality traits. Ego is more than\njust off-putting and obnoxious. Instead, it’s the sworn enemy of our ability to learn and grow.\nAs Epictetus put it, “It is impossible for a person to begin to learn what he thinks he already knows.”\nToday, we will be unable to improve, unable to learn, unable to earn the respect of others if we think\nwe’re already perfect, a genius admired far and wide. In this sense, ego and self-deception are the\nenemies of the things we wish to have because we delude ourselves into believing that we already\npossess them.\nSo we must meet ego with the hostility and contempt that it insidiously deploys against us—to keep it\naway, if only for twenty-four hours at a time.",

    "quote": "Were you to live three thousand years, or even a countless multiple of that, keep in mind that no\none ever loses a life other than the one they are living, and no one ever lives a life other than the\none they are losing. The longest and the shortest life, then, amount to the same, for the present\nmoment lasts the same for all and is all anyone possesses.

That is, wanting the past to be more than what it was\n(different, better, still here, etc.) or wanting the future to unfold exactly as you expect (with hardly a\nthought as to how that might affect other people).\nWhen you do this, you’re neglecting the present moment. Talk about ungrateful! There’s a saying—\nattributed to Bil Keane, the cartoonist—worth remembering: “Yesterday’s the past, tomorrow’s the future,\nbut today is a gift. That’s why it’s called the present.” This present is in our possession—but it has an\nexpiration date, a quickly approaching one. If you enjoy all of it, it will be enough.

A body built from hard work is admirable. A body built\nto impress gym rats is not.\nThat’s what the Stoics urge us to consider.

Someone can’t frustrate you, work can’t overwhelm\nyou—these are external objects, and they have no access to your mind. Those emotions you feel, as real\nas they are, come from the inside, not the outside.\nThe Stoics use the word hypolêpsis, which means “taking up”—of perceptions, thoughts, and\njudgments by our mind. What we assume, what we willingly generate in our mind, that’s on us. We can’t\nblame other people for making us feel stressed or frustrated any more than we can blame them for our\njealousy.

Born in\nBombay when it was still under British control, de Mello was an amalgam of many different cultures\nand perspectives: East, West; he even trained as a psychotherapist. It’s interesting when one sees timeless\nwisdom develop across schools, across epochs and ideas. Here is a quote from de Mello’s book, The\nWay to Love, that sounds almost exactly like Epictetus:“The cause of my irritation is not in this person but in me.”\nRemember, each individual has a choice. You are always the one in control. The cause of irritation—\nor our notion that something is bad—that comes from us, from our labels or our expectations. Just as\neasily, we can change those labels; we can change our entitlement and decide to accept and love what’s\nhappening around us. And this wisdom has been repeated and independently discovered in every century\nand every country since time began",
