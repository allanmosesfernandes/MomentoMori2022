        title: "CONTROL AND CHOICE",
        quote:
          "The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to\nmyself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I\nactually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but\nwithin myself to the choices that are my own . . .",
        text: "The single most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating between what we can change\nand what we can’t. What we have influence over and what we do not. A flight is delayed because of\nweather—no amount of yelling at an airline representative will end a storm. No amount of wishing will\nmake you taller or shorter or born in a different country. No matter how hard you try, you can’t make\nsomeone like you. And on top of that, time spent hurling yourself at these immovable objects is time not\nspent on the things we can change.\nThe recovery community practices something called the Serenity Prayer: “God, grant me the serenity\nto accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the\ndifference.” Addicts cannot change the abuse suffered in childhood. They cannot undo the choices they\nhave made or the hurt they have caused. But they can change the future—through the power they have in\nthe present moment. As Epictetus said, they can control the choices they make right now.\nThe same is true for us today. If we can focus on making clear what parts of our day are within our\ncontrol and what parts are not, we will not only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over other\npeople who fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable battle.",

Education—reading and meditating on the wisdom of great minds—is not to be done for its own sake. It has a purpose.

        text: "One of the hardest things to do in life is to say “No.” To invitations, to requests, to obligations, to the stuff that everyone else is doing. Even harder is saying no to certain time-consuming emotions: anger, excitement, distraction, obsession, lust. None of these impulses feels like a big deal by itself, but run amok, they become a commitment like anything else. If you’re not careful, these are precisely the impositions that will overwhelm and consume your life. Do you ever wonder how you can get some of your time back, how you can feel less busy? Start by learning the power of “No!”—as in “No, thank you,” and “No, I’m not going to get caught up in that,” and “No, I just can’t right now.” It may hurt some feelings. It may turn people off. It may take some hard work.But the more you say no to the things that don’t matter, the more you can say yes to the things that do.

Here was a guy who had every reason to be angry and bitter, who could have abandoned\nhis principles and lived in luxury or ease, who could have put his responsibilities aside and focused on\nhis own health.\nBut he never did.

That’s what our reason can do—it\ncan take the crooked, confusing, and overwhelming nature of external\nevents and make them orderly.\nHowever, if our judgments are crooked because we don’t use reason,\nthen everything that follows will be crooked, and we will lose our ability to\nsteady ourselves in the chaos and rush of life.

Marcus, thankfully, was not exposed to these extreme parts of our modern culture. But he knew plenty of distracting sinkholes too: gossip, the endless call of work, as well as fear, suspicion, lust. Every human being is pulled by these internal and external forces that are increasingly more powerful and harder to resist. Philosophy is simply asking us to pay careful attention and to strive to be more than a pawn.

Rather, it’s that we can rest assured we’re heading\ngenerally in the right direction—that we don’t need to constantly compare ourselves with other people or\nchange our mind every three seconds based on new information.\nInstead, tranquility and peace are found in identifying our path and in sticking to it: staying the course\n—making adjustments here and there, naturally—but ignoring the distracting sirens who beckon us to turn\ntoward the rocks",

In one passage, he praises the “charm and allure” of nature’s process, the “stalks of ripe grain bending low, the frowning brow of the lion, the foam dripping from the boar’s mouth.” We should thank private rhetoric teacher Marcus Cornelius Fronto for the imagery in these vivid passages. Fronto, widely considered to be Rome’s best orator besides Cicero, was chosen by Marcus’s adopted father to teach Marcus to think and write and speak. More than just pretty phrases, they gave him—and now us—a powerful perspective on ordinary or seemingly unbeautiful events. It takes an artist’s eye to see that the end of life is not unlike a ripe fruit falling from its tree. It takes a poet to notice the way “baking bread splits in places and those cracks, while not intended in the baker’s art, catch our eye and serve to stir our appetite” and find a metaphor in them. There is clarity (and joy) in seeing what others can’t see, in finding grace and harmony in places others overlook. Isn’t that far better than seeing the world as some dark place?",

In fact, it probably happened to Marcus—that may be why he scribbled this note to himself. Perhaps he’d been dealing with difficult senators or having difficulties with his troubled son. Perhaps in these scenarios he’d lost his temper, became depressed, or stopped checking in with himself. Who wouldn’t? But the reminder here is that no matter what happens, no matter how disappointing our behavior has been in the past, the principles themselves remain unchanged. We can return and embrace them at any moment. What happened yesterday—what happened five minutes ago—is the past. We can reignite and restart whenever we like. Why not do it right now ?",

None of these things.\nWhat, then? A rational being.\nWhat then is demanded of me? Meditate on your actions.\nHow did I steer away from serenity?\nWhat did I do that was unfriendly, unsocial, or uncaring?\nWhat did I fail to do in all these things?",

For others, it’s exercise.\nFor many, it’s journaling—just a few pages where they write down their thoughts, fears, hopes. In\nthese cases, the point is not so much the activity itself as it is the ritualized reflection. The idea is to take\nsome time to look inward and examine.\nTaking that time is what Stoics advocated more than almost anything else. We don’t know whether\nMarcus Aurelius wrote his Meditations in the morning or at night, but we know he carved out moments of\nquiet alone time—and that he wrote for himself, not for anyone else. If you’re looking for a place to start\nyour own ritual, you could do worse than Marcus’s example and Epictetus’s checklist.\nEvery day, starting today, ask yourself these same tough questions. Let philosophy and hard work\nguide you to better answers, one morning at a time, over the course of a life.",

How can I\nimprove?\nAt the beginning or end of each day, the Stoic sits down with his journal and reviews: what he did,\nwhat he thought, what could be improved. It’s for this reason that Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations is a\nsomewhat inscrutable book—it was for personal clarity and not public benefit. Writing down Stoic\nexercises was and is also a form of practicing them, just as repeating a prayer or hymn might be.\nKeep your own journal, whether it’s saved on a computer or in a little notebook.

The second has to do with impulses to act and not to act—and more\nbroadly, with duty—that a person may act deliberately for good reasons and not carelessly. The\nthird has to do with freedom from deception and composure and the whole area of judgment, the\nassent our mind gives to its perceptions. Of these areas, the chief and most urgent is the first\nwhich has to do with the passions, for strong emotions arise only when we fail in our desires\nand aversions.",
        text: "Today, let’s focus on the three areas of training that Epictetus laid out for us.\nFirst, we must consider what we should desire and what we should be averse to. Why? So that\nwe want what is good and avoid what is bad. It’s not enough to just listen to your body—because our\nattractions often lead us astray.\nNext, we must examine our impulses to act—that is, our motivations. Are we doing things for the right\nreasons? Or do we act because we haven’t stopped to think? Or do we believe that we have to do\nsomething?\nFinally, there is our judgment. Our ability to see things clearly and properly comes when we use our\ngreat gift from nature: reason.\nThese are three distinct areas of training, but in practice they are inextricably intertwined. Our\njudgment affects what we desire, our desires affect how we act, just as our judgment determines how we\nact. But we can’t just expect this to happen. We must put real thought and energy into each area of our\nlives. If we do, we’ll find real clarity and success.",

        text: "Only the paranoid survive,” Andy Grove, a former CEO of Intel, famously said. It might be true.\nBut we also know that the paranoid often destroy themselves quicker and more spectacularly than\nany enemy. Seneca, with his access and insight into the most powerful elite in Rome, would have seen this\ndynamic play out quite vividly. Nero, the student whose excesses Seneca tried to curb, killed not only his\nown mother and wife but eventually turned on Seneca, his mentor, too.\nThe combination of power, fear, and mania can be deadly. The leader, convinced that he might be\nbetrayed, acts first and betrays others first. Afraid that he’s not well liked, he works so hard to get others\nto like him that it has the opposite effect. Convinced of mismanagement, he micromanages and becomes\nthe source of the mismanagement. And on and on—the things we fear or dread, we blindly inflict on\nourselves.\nThe next time you are afraid of some supposedly disastrous outcome, remember that if you don’t\ncontrol your impulses, if you lose your self-control, you may be the very source of the disaster you so\nfear. It has happened to smarter and more powerful and more successful people. It can happen to us too",

We get upset, then the other person gets upset—now everyone is upset, and the\nproblem is no closer to getting solved.\nMany successful people will try to tell you that anger is a powerful fuel in their lives. The desire to\n“prove them all wrong” or “shove it in their faces” has made many a millionaire. The anger at being\ncalled fat or stupid has created fine physical specimens and brilliant minds. The anger at being rejected\nhas motivated many to carve their own path.\nBut that’s shortsighted. Such stories ignore the pollution produced as a side effect and the wear and\ntear it put on the engine. It ignores what happens when that initial anger runs out—and how now more and\nmore must be generated to keep the machine going (until, eventually, the only source left is anger at\noneself). “Hate is too great a burden to bear,” Martin Luther King Jr. warned his fellow civil rights\nleaders in 1967, even though they had every reason to respond to hate with hate.\nThe same is true for anger—in fact, it’s true for most extreme emotions.

Yet, not many years later, Epictetus would become a close friend of another emperor, Hadrian, who would help Marcus Aurelius to the throne, one of the truest examples of a wise philosopher king. So it’s not so clear that power always corrupts. In fact, it looks like it comes down, in many ways, to the inner strength and self-awareness of individuals—what they value, what desires they keep in check, whether their understanding of fairness and justice can counteract the temptations of unlimited wealth and deference.

Rather than taking it out on that person directly, he’d write a long letter, outlining his case why they were wrong and what he wanted them to know. Then Lincoln would fold it up, put the letter in the desk drawer, and never send it. Many of these letters survive only by chance. He knew, as the former emperor of Rome knew, that it’s easy to fight back. It’s tempting to give them a piece of your mind. But you almost always end up with regret. You almost always wish you hadn’t sent the letter. Think of the last time you flew off the handle. What was the outcome? Was there any benefit?",

Well, if you take a second to consider\nsex in such an absurd light, you may be less likely to do something shameful or embarrassing in the pursuit\nof it. It’s a counterbalance to the natural bias we have toward something that feels really good.\nWe can apply this same way of thinking to a lot of things that people prize. Consider that envy inducing photo you see on social media—imagine the person painstakingly staging it. What about that job\npromotion that means so much? Look at the lives of other so-called successful people. Still think it holds\nmagical power? Money, which we want more of and are reluctant to part with—consider how covered in\nbacteria and filth it is. That beautiful, perfect person you’re admiring from afar? Remember that if they’re\nsingle, other people must have dumped them at some point. There must be something wrong with them.\nThis exercise won’t turn you into a cynic. But it will provide some much-needed objectivity",

In these discussions—or what record we have of them—there are\nmany examples of his conversation mates getting exasperated, upset, or aggravated by his many questions.\nIndeed, the people of Athens eventually got so upset, they sentenced Socrates to death.\nBut Socrates never seemed to get upset himself. Even when talking about matters of life and death, he\nalways kept his cool. He was much more interested in hearing what the other person had to say than\nmaking sure he was heard or—as most of us insist upon—winning the argument.\nThe next time you face a political dispute or a personal disagreement, ask yourself: Is there any\nreason to fight about this? Is arguing going to help solve anything? Would an educated or wise person\nreally be as quarrelsome as you might initially be inclined to be? Or would they take a breath, relax, and\nresist the temptation for conflict? Just think of what you could accomplish—and how much better you\nwould feel—if you could conquer the need to fight and win every tiny little thing.",

For eighteen of those years, he had a bucket for a toilet, a hard cot in a small\ncell, and once a year he was allowed a single visitor—for thirty minutes. It was vicious treatment meant\nto isolate and break down the prisoners. And yet, in spite of that, Mandela became a figure of dignity\nwithin the prison.\nThough he was deprived of many things, he still found creative ways to assert his will. As one of his\nfellow prisoners, Neville Alexander, explained on Frontline, “He [Mandela] always made the point, if\nthey say you must run, insist on walking. If they say you must walk fast, insist on walking slowly. That was\nthe whole point. We are going to set the terms.” He pretended to jump rope and shadowboxed to stay in\nshape. He held his head higher than other prisoners, encouraged them when times got tough, and always\nretained his sense of self-assurance.\nThat self-assurance is yours to claim as well. No matter what happens today, no matter where you find\nyourself, shift to what lies within your reasoned choices.

If you were to hope for\none thing, you could hope for the strength of character that’s able to thrive\nin good fortune. Or better, work for that kind of character and confidence.\nConsider every action and every thought—think of them as building blocks\nof your indestructible character. Then work to make each one strong and\nsignificant in its own right.",

They even used the Greek word\ntyrannodidaskalos—tyrant teacher—to describe him. And just as\nShakespeare observed in Macbeth, “Bloody instructions, which, being\ntaught, return / To plague th’inventor,” Seneca’s collaboration with Nero\nultimately ended with the student murdering the teacher.\nIt’s something to think about when you consider whom to work with and\nwhom to do business with in life.
