        "title": "CONTROL AND CHOICE",
        "quote": "The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to\nmyself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I\nactually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but\nwithin myself to the choices that are my own . . .",
        "text": "The single most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating between what we can change\nand what we can’t. What we have influence over and what we do not. A flight is delayed because of\nweather—no amount of yelling at an airline representative will end a storm. No amount of wishing will\nmake you taller or shorter or born in a different country. No matter how hard you try, you can’t make\nsomeone like you. And on top of that, time spent hurling yourself at these immovable objects is time not\nspent on the things we can change.\nThe recovery community practices something called the Serenity Prayer: “God, grant me the serenity\nto accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the\ndifference.” Addicts cannot change the abuse suffered in childhood. They cannot undo the choices they\nhave made or the hurt they have caused. But they can change the future—through the power they have in\nthe present moment. As Epictetus said, they can control the choices they make right now.\nThe same is true for us today. If we can focus on making clear what parts of our day are within our\ncontrol and what parts are not, we will not only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over other\npeople who fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable battle.",

        "text": "Why did you pick up this book? Why pick up any book? Not to seem smarter, not to pass time on the plane, not to hear what you want to hear—there are plenty of easier choices than reading. No, you picked up this book because you are learning how to live. Because you want to be freer, fear less, and achieve a state of peace. Education—reading and meditating on the wisdom of great minds—is not to be done for its own sake. It has a purpose. Remember that imperative on the days you start to feel distracted, when watching television or having a snack seems like a better use of your time than reading or studying philosophy. Knowledge—self\u0002knowledge in particular—is freedom.",

        "quote": "“How many have laid waste to your life when you weren’t aware of what you were losing, how much was wasted in pointless grief, foolish joy, greedy desire, and social amusements—how little of your own was left to you. You will realize you are dying before your time!”",
        "text": "One of the hardest things to do in life is to say “No.” To invitations, to requests, to obligations, to the stuff that everyone else is doing. Even harder is saying no to certain time-consuming emotions: anger, excitement, distraction, obsession, lust. None of these impulses feels like a big deal by itself, but run amok, they become a commitment like anything else. If you’re not careful, these are precisely the impositions that will overwhelm and consume your life. Do you ever wonder how you can get some of your time back, how you can feel less busy? Start by learning the power of “No!”—as in “No, thank you,” and “No, I’m not going to get caught up in that,” and “No, I just can’t right now.” It may hurt some feelings. It may turn people off. It may take some hard work.But the more you say no to the things that don’t matter, the more you can say yes to the things that do. This will let you live and enjoy your life—the life that you want.",

        "quote": "It’s a disgrace in this life when the soul surrenders first while the body refuses to",
        "text": "Despite his privileges, Marcus Aurelius had a difficult life. The Roman historian Cassius Dio mused\nthat Marcus “did not meet with the good fortune that he deserved, for he was not strong in body and\nwas involved in a multitude of troubles throughout practically his entire reign.” At one point, he was so\nsick that a rumor spread that he had died—and matters were made worse when his most trusted general\nused it as an opportunity to declare himself the new emperor.\nBut throughout these struggles—the years at war, the crippling illnesses, his troubled son—he never\ngave up. It’s an inspiring example for us to think about today if we get tired, frustrated, or have to deal\nwith some crisis. Here was a guy who had every reason to be angry and bitter, who could have abandoned\nhis principles and lived in luxury or ease, who could have put his responsibilities aside and focused on\nhis own health.\nBut he never did. His soul stayed strong even after his body became weak. He didn’t give up, right up\nto the second until his body finally did—when he died near Vienna in 180 AD.",

According to the Stoics,\nthe circle of control contains just one thing: YOUR MIND. That’s right, even your physical body isn’t\ncompletely within the circle. After all, you could be struck with a physical illness or impairment at any\nmoment. You could be traveling in a foreign country and be thrown in jail.\nBut this is all good news because it drastically reduces the amount of things that you need to think\nabout. There is clarity in simplicity. While everyone else is running around with a list of responsibilities\na mile long—things they’re not actually responsible for—you’ve got just that one-item list.

        "quote": "Understand at last that you have something in you more powerful and divine than what causes the\nbodily passions and pulls you like a mere puppet. What thoughts now occupy my mind? Is it not\nfear, suspicion, desire, or something like that?",
        "text": "Think of all the interests vying for a share of your wallet or for a second of your attention. Food scientists are engineering products to exploit your taste buds. Silicon Valley engineers are designing applications as addictive as gambling. The media is manufacturing stories to provoke outrage and anger. These are just a small slice of the temptations and forces acting on us—distracting us and pulling us away from the things that truly matter. Marcus, thankfully, was not exposed to these extreme parts of our modern culture. But he knew plenty of distracting sinkholes too: gossip, the endless call of work, as well as fear, suspicion, lust. Every human being is pulled by these internal and external forces that are increasingly more powerful and harder to resist. Philosophy is simply asking us to pay careful attention and to strive to be more than a pawn. As Viktor Frankl puts it in The Will to Meaning, “Man is pushed by drives but pulled by values.” These values and inner awareness prevent us from being puppets. Sure, paying attention requires work and awareness, but isn’t that better than being jerked about on a string?",

        "quote": "Tranquility can’t be grasped except by those who have reached an unwavering and firm power\nof judgment—the rest constantly fall and rise in their decisions, wavering in a state of\nalternately rejecting and accepting things. What is the cause of this back and forth? It’s because\nnothing is clear and they rely on the most uncertain guide—common opinion.”",
        "text": "In Seneca’s essay on tranquility, he uses the Greek word euthymia, which he defines as “believing in\nyourself and trusting that you are on the right path, and not being in doubt by following the myriad\nfootpaths of those wandering in every direction.” It is this state of mind, he says, that produces tranquility.\nClarity of vision allows us to have this belief. That’s not to say we’re always going to be 100 percent\ncertain of everything, or that we even should be. Rather, it’s that we can rest assured we’re heading\ngenerally in the right direction—that we don’t need to constantly compare ourselves with other people or\nchange our mind every three seconds based on new information.\nInstead, tranquility and peace are found in identifying our path and in sticking to it: staying the course\n—making adjustments here and there, naturally—but ignoring the distracting sirens who beckon us to turn\ntoward the rocks",

The worker has stopped thinking and is mindlessly operating out of habit. The business is ripe for disruption by a competitor, and the worker will probably get fired by any thinking boss. We should apply the same ruthlessness to our own habits. In fact, we are studying philosophy precisely to break ourselves of rote behavior. Find what you do out of rote memory or routine.

        "text": "There are some stunningly beautiful turns of phrase in Marcus’s Meditations—a surprising treat considering the intended audience (just himself). In one passage, he praises the “charm and allure” of nature’s process, the “stalks of ripe grain bending low, the frowning brow of the lion, the foam dripping from the boar’s mouth.” We should thank private rhetoric teacher Marcus Cornelius Fronto for the imagery in these vivid passages. Fronto, widely considered to be Rome’s best orator besides Cicero, was chosen by Marcus’s adopted father to teach Marcus to think and write and speak. More than just pretty phrases, they gave him—and now us—a powerful perspective on ordinary or seemingly unbeautiful events. It takes an artist’s eye to see that the end of life is not unlike a ripe fruit falling from its tree. It takes a poet to notice the way “baking bread splits in places and those cracks, while not intended in the baker’s art, catch our eye and serve to stir our appetite” and find a metaphor in them. There is clarity (and joy) in seeing what others can’t see, in finding grace and harmony in places others overlook. Isn’t that far better than seeing the world as some dark place?",

But the reminder here is that no matter what happens, no matter how disappointing our behavior has been in the past, the principles themselves remain unchanged.

It’s for this reason that Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations is a\nsomewhat inscrutable book—it was for personal clarity and not public benefit. Writing down Stoic\nexercises was and is also a form of practicing them, just as repeating a prayer or hymn might be.\nKeep your own journal, whether it’s saved on a computer or in a little notebook.

        "text": "The first book of Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations begins with a catalog of gratitude. He thanks, one by\none, the leading influences in his life. One of the people he thanks is Quintus Junius Rusticus, a\nteacher who developed in his student a love of deep clarity and understanding—a desire to not just stop at\nthe surface when it comes to learning.\nIt was also from Rusticus that Marcus was introduced to Epictetus. In fact, Rusticus loaned Marcus his\npersonal copy of Epictetus’s lectures. Marcus clearly wasn’t satisfied with just getting the gist of these\nlectures and didn’t simply accept them on his teacher’s recommendation. Paul Johnson once joked that\nEdmund Wilson read books “as though the author was on trial for his life.” That’s how Marcus read\nEpictetus—and when the lessons passed muster, he absorbed them. They became part of his DNA as a\nhuman being. He quoted them at length over the course of his life, finding real clarity and strength in\nwords, even amid the immense luxury and power he would come to possess.\nThat’s the kind of deep reading and study we need to cultivate as well, which is why we’re reading\njust one page a day instead of a chapter at a time. So we can take the time to read attentively and deeply.",

The second has to do with impulses to act and not to act—and more\nbroadly, with duty—that a person may act deliberately for good reasons and not carelessly. The\nthird has to do with freedom from deception and composure and the whole area of judgment, the\nassent our mind gives to its perceptions. Of these areas, the chief and most urgent is the first\nwhich has to do with the passions, for strong emotions arise only when we fail in our desires\nand aversions.",
        "text": "Today, let’s focus on the three areas of training that Epictetus laid out for us.\nFirst, we must consider what we should desire and what we should be averse to. Why? So that\nwe want what is good and avoid what is bad. It’s not enough to just listen to your body—because our\nattractions often lead us astray.\nNext, we must examine our impulses to act—that is, our motivations. Are we doing things for the right\nreasons? Or do we act because we haven’t stopped to think? Or do we believe that we have to do\nsomething?\nFinally, there is our judgment. Our ability to see things clearly and properly comes when we use our\ngreat gift from nature: reason.\nThese are three distinct areas of training, but in practice they are inextricably intertwined. Our\njudgment affects what we desire, our desires affect how we act, just as our judgment determines how we\nact. But we can’t just expect this to happen. We must put real thought and energy into each area of our\nlives. If we do, we’ll find real clarity and success.",

Our adrenal\nglands can handle only so much before they become exhausted. Shouldn’t you preserve them for life-and\u0002death situations?\nSo yes, use Stoicism to manage these difficulties. But don’t forget to ask: Is this really the life I want?\nEvery time you get upset, a little bit of life leaves the body.

Because fate can always intervene and then we’ll likely\nlose our self-control in response.\nAs Diogenes, the famous Cynic, once said, “It is the privilege of the gods to want nothing, and of\ngodlike men to want little.” To want nothing makes one invincible—because nothing lies outside your\ncontrol.

After all, external events\nare not sentient beings—they cannot respond to our shouts and cries—and neither can the mostly\nindifferent gods.\nThat’s what Marcus was reminding himself of here: circumstances are incapable of considering or\ncaring for your feelings, your anxiety, or your excitement.

The second half of Goethe’s maxim is important too. He states that it is equally damaging to\n“value yourself at less than your true worth.” Is it not equally common to be surprised at how well we’re\nable to handle a previously feared scenario? The way that we’re able to put aside the grief for a loved\none and care for others—though we always thought we’d be wrecked if something were to happen to our\nparents or a sibling. The way we’re able to rise to the occasion in a stressful situation or a life-changing\nopportunity.\nWe underestimate our capabilities just as much and just as dangerously as we overestimate other\nabilities.

And\nyet, almost to a person, they were wrong—and wrong to the tune of global market havoc.\nIt’s not hard to look at that situation and understand that greed was some part of the problem. Greed\nwas what led people to create complex markets that no one understood in the hope of making a quick\nbuck. Greed caused other people to make trades on strange pools of debt. Greed prevented anyone from\ncalling out this situation for what it was—a house of cards just waiting for the slightest breeze to knock it\nall down.\nIt doesn’t do you much good to criticize those folks after the fact.

One of\nthe things that frustrated Epictetus about philosophy students—and has frustrated all college professors\nsince time began—is how students claim to want to be taught but really secretly believe they already\nknow everything.\nThe reality is that we’re all guilty of thinking we know it all, and we’d all learn more if we could set\nthat attitude aside. As smart or successful as we may be, there is always someone who is smarter, more\nsuccessful, and wiser than us. Emerson put it well: “Every man I meet is my master in some point, and in\nthat I learn of him.”\nIf you want to learn, if you want to improve your life, seeking out teachers, philosophers, and great\nbooks is a good start.

    "text": "Thyestes is one of Seneca’s darkest and most disturbing plays. Even two thousand years later it\nremains a classic of the revenge genre. Without spoiling it, the quote above comes from the scene in\nwhich Atreus is attempting to lure his hated brother Thyestes into a cruel trap by offering him tempting\nand generous gifts. At first, Thyestes declines, to the complete bafflement of his enemy.\nWe are typically surprised when someone turns down an expensive gift or a position of honor or\nsuccess. General William T. Sherman emphatically rejected offers to run for president of the United\nStates, saying at one point: “I will not accept if nominated and will not serve if elected.” If his friend\nUlysses S. Grant had made such a “Shermanesque statement” (as such rejections are now known), Grant\ncertainly would have preserved his own legacy from the disastrous turn of events it suffered.\nDespite his initial misgivings, Thyestes is ultimately tempted and persuaded to accept “fortune’s\ngifts,” . . . which turned out to be a ruse hiding devastating tragedy. Not every opportunity is fraught with\ndanger, but the play was intended to remind us that our attraction toward what is new and shiny can lead\nus into serious trouble",

    "quote": "Joy for human beings lies in proper human work. And proper human work consists in: acts of\nkindness to other human beings, disdain for the stirrings of the senses, identifying trustworthy\nimpressions, and contemplating the natural order and all that happens in keeping with it.",
    "text": "When dog trainers are brought in to work with a dysfunctional or unhappy dog, they usually start with\none question: “Do you take it for walks?” They ask because dogs were bred to do certain tasks—\nto do work—and when deprived of this essential part of their nature, they suffer and act out. This is true\nno matter how spoiled and nice their life might be.\nThe same is true for humans. When you hear the Stoics brush aside certain emotions or material\nluxuries, it’s not because they don’t enjoy them. It’s not because the Stoic life is one bereft of happiness or\nfun. The Stoics simply mean to help us find our essence—to experience the joy of our proper human work.",

    "title": "STOP CARING WHAT PEOPLE THINK",
    "quote": "I’m constantly amazed by how easily we love ourselves above all others, yet we put more stock\nin the opinions of others than in our own estimation of self. . . . How much credence we give to\nthe opinions our peers have of us and how little to our very own!",
    "text": "How quickly we can disregard our own feelings about something and adopt someone else’s. We think\na shirt looks good at the store but will view it with shame and scorn if our spouse or a coworker\nmakes an offhand remark. We can be immensely happy with our own lives—until we find out that\nsomeone we don’t even like has more. Or worse and more precariously, we don’t feel good about our\naccomplishments or talents until some third party validates them.\nLike most Stoic exercises, this one attempts to teach us that although we control our own opinions, we\ndon’t control what other people think—about us least of all. For this reason, putting ourselves at the\nmercy of those opinions and trying to gain the approval of others are a dangerous endeavor.\nDon’t spend much time thinking about what other people think. Think about what you think. Think\ninstead about the results, about the impact, about whether it is the right thing to do.",

    "quote": "Well-being is realized by small steps, but is truly no small thing.",
    "text": "The famous biographer Diogenes Laertius attributes this quote to Zeno but admits that it might have\nalso been said by Socrates, meaning that it may be a quote of a quote of a quote. But does it really\nmatter? Truth is truth.\nIn this case, the truth is one we know well: the little things add up. Someone is a good person not\nbecause they say they are, but because they take good actions. One does not magically get one’s act\ntogether—it is a matter of many individual choices. It’s a matter of getting up at the right time, making\nyour bed, resisting shortcuts, investing in yourself, doing your work. And make no mistake: while the\nindividual action is small, its cumulative impact is not.\nThink about all the small choices that will roll themselves out in front of you today. Do you know\nwhich are the right way and which are the easy way? Choose the right way, and watch as all these little\nthings add up toward transformation.",

    "title": "THE FIRST TWO THINGS BEFORE ACTING",
    "quote": "The first thing to do—don’t get worked up. For everything happens according to the nature of all\nthings, and in a short time you’ll be nobody and nowhere, even as the great emperors Hadrian\nand Augustus are now. The next thing to do—consider carefully the task at hand for what it is,\nwhile remembering that your purpose is to be a good human being. Get straight to doing what\nnature requires of you, and speak as you see most just and fitting—with kindness, modesty, and\nsincerity",
    "text": "Imagine, for a second, what Marcus’s life as an emperor must have been like. He would preside over\nthe Senate. He would lead the troops in battle, direct the grand strategy of the army as its highest\ncommander. He would also hear appeals—from citizens, from lawyers, from foreign governments. In\nother words, like most people in power, he was called on to make decisions: all day, every day, decision\nafter decision.\nHis formula for decision making is a battle-tested method for doing and acting right—literally. Which\nis why we ought to try to use it ourselves.\nFirst, don’t get upset—because that will color your decision negatively and make it harder than it\nneeds to be.\nSecond, remember the purpose and principles you value most. Running potential actions through this\nfilter will eliminate the bad choices and highlight the right ones.\nDon’t get upset.\nDo the right thing.\nThat’s it.",

    "quote": "Work nourishes noble minds.",
    "text": "You know that feeling you get when you haven’t been to the gym in a few days? A bit doughy.\nIrritable. Claustrophobic. Uncertain. Others get a similar feeling when they’ve been on vacation for\ntoo long or right after they first retire. The mind and the body are there to be used—they begin to turn on\nthemselves when not put to some productive end.\nIt’s sad to think that this kind of frustration is an everyday reality for a lot of people. They leave so\nmuch of their potential unfulfilled because they have jobs where they don’t really do much or because they\nhave too much time on their hands. Worse is when we try to push these feelings away by buying things,\ngoing out, fighting, creating drama—indulging in the empty calories of existence instead of finding the real\nnourishment.\nThe solution is simple and, thankfully, always right at hand. Get out there and work.",
