        title: "CONTROL AND CHOICE",
        quote:
          "The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to\nmyself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I\nactually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but\nwithin myself to the choices that are my own . . .",
        text: "The single most important practice in Stoic philosophy is differentiating between what we can change\nand what we can’t. What we have influence over and what we do not. A flight is delayed because of\nweather—no amount of yelling at an airline representative will end a storm. No amount of wishing will\nmake you taller or shorter or born in a different country. No matter how hard you try, you can’t make\nsomeone like you. And on top of that, time spent hurling yourself at these immovable objects is time not\nspent on the things we can change.\nThe recovery community practices something called the Serenity Prayer: “God, grant me the serenity\nto accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the\ndifference.” Addicts cannot change the abuse suffered in childhood. They cannot undo the choices they\nhave made or the hurt they have caused. But they can change the future—through the power they have in\nthe present moment. As Epictetus said, they can control the choices they make right now.\nThe same is true for us today. If we can focus on making clear what parts of our day are within our\ncontrol and what parts are not, we will not only be happier, we will have a distinct advantage over other\npeople who fail to realize they are fighting an unwinnable battle.",

Not to seem smarter, not to pass time on the plane, not to hear what you want to hear—there are plenty of easier choices than reading. No, you picked up this book because you are learning how to live. Because you want to be freer, fear less, and achieve a state of peace. Education—reading and meditating on the wisdom of great minds—is not to be done for its own sake. It has a purpose. Remember that imperative on the days you start to feel distracted, when watching television or having a snack seems like a better use of your time than reading or studying philosophy. Knowledge—selfknowledge in particular—is freedom.",

        text: "One of the hardest things to do in life is to say “No.” To invitations, to requests, to obligations, to the stuff that everyone else is doing. Even harder is saying no to certain time-consuming emotions: anger, excitement, distraction, obsession, lust. None of these impulses feels like a big deal by itself, but run amok, they become a commitment like anything else. If you’re not careful, these are precisely the impositions that will overwhelm and consume your life. Do you ever wonder how you can get some of your time back, how you can feel less busy? Start by learning the power of “No!”—as in “No, thank you,” and “No, I’m not going to get caught up in that,” and “No, I just can’t right now.” It may hurt some feelings. It may turn people off. It may take some hard work.But the more you say no to the things that don’t matter, the more you can say yes to the things that do. This will let you live and enjoy your life—the life that you want.",

The Roman historian Cassius Dio mused\nthat Marcus “did not meet with the good fortune that he deserved, for he was not strong in body and\nwas involved in a multitude of troubles throughout practically his entire reign.” At one point, he was so\nsick that a rumor spread that he had died—and matters were made worse when his most trusted general\nused it as an opportunity to declare himself the new emperor.\nBut throughout these struggles—the years at war, the crippling illnesses, his troubled son—he never\ngave up. It’s an inspiring example for us to think about today if we get tired, frustrated, or have to deal\nwith some crisis. Here was a guy who had every reason to be angry and bitter, who could have abandoned\nhis principles and lived in luxury or ease, who could have put his responsibilities aside and focused on\nhis own health.\nBut he never did. His soul stayed strong even after his body became weak. He didn’t give up, right up\nto the second until his body finally did—when he died near Vienna in 180 AD.",

        text: "Think of all the interests vying for a share of your wallet or for a second of your attention. Food scientists are engineering products to exploit your taste buds. Silicon Valley engineers are designing applications as addictive as gambling. The media is manufacturing stories to provoke outrage and anger. These are just a small slice of the temptations and forces acting on us—distracting us and pulling us away from the things that truly matter. Marcus, thankfully, was not exposed to these extreme parts of our modern culture. But he knew plenty of distracting sinkholes too: gossip, the endless call of work, as well as fear, suspicion, lust. Every human being is pulled by these internal and external forces that are increasingly more powerful and harder to resist. Philosophy is simply asking us to pay careful attention and to strive to be more than a pawn. As Viktor Frankl puts it in The Will to Meaning, “Man is pushed by drives but pulled by values.” These values and inner awareness prevent us from being puppets. Sure, paying attention requires work and awareness, but isn’t that better than being jerked about on a string?",

          "Tranquility can’t be grasped except by those who have reached an unwavering and firm power\nof judgment—the rest constantly fall and rise in their decisions, wavering in a state of\nalternately rejecting and accepting things. What is the cause of this back and forth? It’s because\nnothing is clear and they rely on the most uncertain guide—common opinion.”",
        text: "In Seneca’s essay on tranquility, he uses the Greek word euthymia, which he defines as “believing in\nyourself and trusting that you are on the right path, and not being in doubt by following the myriad\nfootpaths of those wandering in every direction.” It is this state of mind, he says, that produces tranquility.\nClarity of vision allows us to have this belief. That’s not to say we’re always going to be 100 percent\ncertain of everything, or that we even should be. Rather, it’s that we can rest assured we’re heading\ngenerally in the right direction—that we don’t need to constantly compare ourselves with other people or\nchange our mind every three seconds based on new information.\nInstead, tranquility and peace are found in identifying our path and in sticking to it: staying the course\n—making adjustments here and there, naturally—but ignoring the distracting sirens who beckon us to turn\ntoward the rocks",

The worker has stopped thinking and is mindlessly operating out of habit. The business is ripe for disruption by a competitor, and the worker will probably get fired by any thinking boss. We should apply the same ruthlessness to our own habits. In fact, we are studying philosophy precisely to break ourselves of rote behavior. Find what you do out of rote memory or routine.

        text: "There are some stunningly beautiful turns of phrase in Marcus’s Meditations—a surprising treat considering the intended audience (just himself). In one passage, he praises the “charm and allure” of nature’s process, the “stalks of ripe grain bending low, the frowning brow of the lion, the foam dripping from the boar’s mouth.” We should thank private rhetoric teacher Marcus Cornelius Fronto for the imagery in these vivid passages. Fronto, widely considered to be Rome’s best orator besides Cicero, was chosen by Marcus’s adopted father to teach Marcus to think and write and speak. More than just pretty phrases, they gave him—and now us—a powerful perspective on ordinary or seemingly unbeautiful events. It takes an artist’s eye to see that the end of life is not unlike a ripe fruit falling from its tree. It takes a poet to notice the way “baking bread splits in places and those cracks, while not intended in the baker’s art, catch our eye and serve to stir our appetite” and find a metaphor in them. There is clarity (and joy) in seeing what others can’t see, in finding grace and harmony in places others overlook. Isn’t that far better than seeing the world as some dark place?",

It’s for this reason that Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations is a\nsomewhat inscrutable book—it was for personal clarity and not public benefit.

One of the people he thanks is Quintus Junius Rusticus, a\nteacher who developed in his student a love of deep clarity and understanding—a desire to not just stop at\nthe surface when it comes to learning.\nIt was also from Rusticus that Marcus was introduced to Epictetus.

Paul Johnson once joked that\nEdmund Wilson read books “as though the author was on trial for his life.” That’s how Marcus read\nEpictetus—and when the lessons passed muster, he absorbed them. They became part of his DNA as a\nhuman being. He quoted them at length over the course of his life, finding real clarity and strength in\nwords, even amid the immense luxury and power he would come to possess.\nThat’s the kind of deep reading and study we need to cultivate as well, which is why we’re reading\njust one page a day instead of a chapter at a time. So we can take the time to read attentively and deeply.",

The second has to do with impulses to act and not to act—and more\nbroadly, with duty—that a person may act deliberately for good reasons and not carelessly. The\nthird has to do with freedom from deception and composure and the whole area of judgment, the\nassent our mind gives to its perceptions. Of these areas, the chief and most urgent is the first\nwhich has to do with the passions, for strong emotions arise only when we fail in our desires\nand aversions.",

So that\nwe want what is good and avoid what is bad. It’s not enough to just listen to your body—because our\nattractions often lead us astray.\nNext, we must examine our impulses to act—that is, our motivations. Are we doing things for the right\nreasons? Or do we act because we haven’t stopped to think? Or do we believe that we have to do\nsomething?\nFinally, there is our judgment. Our ability to see things clearly and properly comes when we use our\ngreat gift from nature: reason.\nThese are three distinct areas of training, but in practice they are inextricably intertwined. Our\njudgment affects what we desire, our desires affect how we act, just as our judgment determines how we\nact. But we can’t just expect this to happen. We must put real thought and energy into each area of our\nlives. If we do, we’ll find real clarity and success.",

        text: "Most people resist the idea of a true self-estimate, probably because they fear it might mean\ndowngrading some of their beliefs about who they are and what they’re capable of. As Goethe’s\nmaxim goes, it is a great failing “to see yourself as more than you are.” How could you really be\nconsidered self-aware if you refuse to consider your weaknesses?\nDon’t fear self-assessment because you’re worried you might have to admit some things about\nyourself. The second half of Goethe’s maxim is important too. He states that it is equally damaging to\n“value yourself at less than your true worth.” Is it not equally common to be surprised at how well we’re\nable to handle a previously feared scenario? The way that we’re able to put aside the grief for a loved\none and care for others—though we always thought we’d be wrecked if something were to happen to our\nparents or a sibling. The way we’re able to rise to the occasion in a stressful situation or a life-changing\nopportunity.\nWe underestimate our capabilities just as much and just as dangerously as we overestimate other\nabilities.

The countless causes, events, and get-togethers we’re too busy to attend but agree to anyway. Take an inventory of your obligations from time to time. How many of these are self-imposed?

On the one hand, we feel an\ninfinitesimal smallness in comparison to the vast universe; on the other, an extreme connectedness to this\nlarger whole.\nObviously, given that we’re in our bodies every day, it’s tempting to think that’s the most important\nthing in the world. But we counteract that bias by looking at nature—at things much bigger than us. A line\nfrom Seneca, which has since become a proverb, expresses Marcus’s insight well: Mundus ipse est\ningens deorum omnium templum (The world itself is a huge temple of all the gods).\nLooking at the beautiful expanse of the sky is an antidote to the nagging pettiness of earthly concerns.\nAnd it is good and sobering to lose yourself in that as often as you can.",

          "The unjust person acts against the gods. For insofar as the nature of the universe made rational\ncreatures for the sake of each other, with an eye toward mutual benefit based on true value and\nnever for harm, anyone breaking nature’s will obviously acts against the oldest of gods.",
        text: "We say of the most heinous acts that they are crimes against nature. We consider certain things to be\nan affront against humanity, saying, “This violates everything we hold dear.” However much we\ndiffer in religion, upbringing, politics, class, or gender, we can come together in agreement there.\nWhy? Because our sense of justice goes marrow deep. We don’t like it when people cut in line; we\ndon’t like freeloaders; we pass laws that protect the defenseless; and we pay our taxes, agreeing, in part,\nto redistribute our wealth to those in need. At the same time, if we think we can get away with it, we\nmight try to cheat or bend the rules. To paraphrase Bill Walsh, when left to our own devices, many of us\nindividuals seek lower ground like water.\nThe key, then, is to support our natural inclination to justice with strong boundaries and strong\ncommitments—to embrace, as Lincoln urged a divided, angry nation to do, “the better angels of our\nnature.",

Seneca was so\nrich that some historians speculate that major loans he made to the\ninhabitants of what is now Britain caused what became a horrifically brutal\nuprising there. His critics’ derisive nickname for him was “The Opulent\nStoic.”\nSeneca’s response to this criticism is pretty simple: he might have\nwealth, but he didn’t need it. He wasn’t dependent on it or addicted to it.\nNor, despite his large bank account, was he considered to be anything close\nto Rome’s most lavish spenders and pleasure hunters. Whether his\nrationalization was true or not (or whether he was a tad hypocritical), his is\na decent prescription for navigating today’s materialistic and wealth-driven\nsociety.\nThis is the pragmatic instead of the moralistic approach to wealth.\nWe can still live well without becoming slaves to luxury. And we don’t\nneed to make decisions that force us to continue to work and work and\nwork and drift further from study and contemplation in order to get more\nmoney to pay for the things we don’t need. There is no rule that says\nfinancial success must mean that you live beyond your means. Remember:\nhumans can be happy with very little.",

Perhaps that was because life in Greece and\nRome was particularly harsh. Animals and people were slaughtered\nsenselessly to amuse the masses in the Colosseum (events lamented in the\nStoic writings). Countries were conquered and its citizens sold into slavery\nto expand the empire (the futility of which the Stoics also lamented). This\nkind of cruelty is possible only when we forget how we’re related to our\nfellow human beings and the environment.\nToday, take a moment to remember that we are woven together and that\neach of us plays a role (good, bad, or ugly) in this world.",

Just because something is good for you definitely doesn’t mean\nit’s good for everyone. Think of the hedge fund managers who bet\nmassively against the economy—they profited by rooting for essentially\neveryone and everything else to fail. Is that who you want to be?

They even used the Greek word\ntyrannodidaskalos—tyrant teacher—to describe him. And just as\nShakespeare observed in Macbeth, “Bloody instructions, which, being\ntaught, return / To plague th’inventor,” Seneca’s collaboration with Nero\nultimately ended with the student murdering the teacher.\nIt’s something to think about when you consider whom to work with and\nwhom to do business with in life. If you show a client how to do something\nunethical or illegal, might they return the favor to an unsuspecting you later\non? If you provide a bad example to your employees, to your associates, to\nyour children, might they betray you or hurt you down the road? What goes\naround comes around, is the saying.

Even if you don’t believe in a deity, you can take some comfort in the various laws of the universe or even the circle of life. What happens to us as individuals can seem random or upsetting or cruel or inexplicable, when in fact these events make perfect sense when our perspective is zoomed out, even just slightly.
